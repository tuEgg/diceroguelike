Now that we are dealing dice, we need to:
- Create the dice bag full of 8 generic d4s, 2 specific d4s per style (for attacking, blocking, healing) and then 1 1d6 per style as well.
	- Colour code these dice red for attack, blue for block, green for heal, grey for generic.
- Add discard functionality where we can drag dice to the discard bag, and create more action queue slots for every dice discarded (1 dice for 1st, 2 dice for 2nd and so on). 
	- Depending on the dice you discard, depends what that slot can be.
	- Discarding an attack and blocking die means that die can be either, and will default do a 1d4 without having dice in that slot.
	- Discarding a generic die means that slot can be anything, but will be empty
	- Colour code each slot with a thin bar at the bottom to denote what that slot can do
- Add toggle functionality to slots depending on its icons underneath (create these icons, sword, shield, plus, circle)
- Add drag and drop into slots functionality.
	- First of all, check compatability with the slot.
		- Any dice can go in a generic slot

- Need to add preventing playing turn if they don't have any actions queued

For swapping out discard with consuming at the last action slot:
- Add last action slot hovering
- Current discard functionality can just be duplicated for last action slot, without adding it to discard pile
- Show possibility circles underneath when we have consumed some of the dice required to create a new slot.

- Fixes from playtesting:
	- Corsair gunner order feels off as they block ahead of the turn you want to defend as well
	- All debuffs should only reduce their duration when they trigger, not at a specific point in the turn. Mock can then only last 1 turn.
	- Starting slot should not exist imo, make players sacrifice die to play at all. Sacrificing 3 generic die to make a blank slot is unfun, as they all become temporary, perhaps generic dice can be base dice, but they will just become empty every turn if not added to with a color?
	- Is only 2 dice a turn interesting? Should that increase every act?
- Come up with 10 relics
	- Make a specific slot more powerful
	- If you use 3 of the same action name in a row
	- Odd number slots gain +1 
	- Stowaway dice gain +1 to their effects
- Come up with 5 provisions
- Come up with 10 new dice types
	- Gain +2 block [if not used]
	- Draw an extra dice next turn [if not used] 
	- Tidal Slash: 2d4 attack but only if [previous slot] is a block
	- Saltwater Surge: Heals 2d4 but [sacrifices] the die
	- Anchor Die: +4 bonus to this slots block, but [subsequent slots] have -1d4.
	- When ejected, grants +1 dice to play next turn
	- [Favourite] always draw this die in your first roll
	- [Partner] if paired with a certain possible_type, does XYZ.
	- Ambitious dice - 1d4 attack, this dice's minimum roll is equal to its slot number.
- Add provisions usable from top bar?
- Add the shop which features 2x relics, 3x dice, 3x provisions
